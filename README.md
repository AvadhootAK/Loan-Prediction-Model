# Loan Prediction App

This is my first end-to-end Machine Learning project — a Loan Prediction App that predicts whether a loan should be approved or not.

It uses **Logistic Regression** as the model and is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

---

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to understand the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model building and deployment.

**Key steps followed:**

1. Collected and cleaned the dataset
2. Encoded categorical variables
3. Scaled numeric features
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluated accuracy (~86%)
6. Built a Streamlit web app interface
7. Deployed the app on Streamlit Cloud

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction-app.git
   cd loan-prediction-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
